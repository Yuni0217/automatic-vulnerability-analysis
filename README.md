AVA
==========
AVA(short for Automatic Vulnerability Analysis), is an open-source toolkit that employs a cross-linked and correlated database to collect, extract, filter and visualise vulnerability data across multiple existing repositories. The purpose is to support a higher level of automation in vulnerability awareness and risk-analysis exercises. 

More details can be found in our paper:

This package is designed for the following groups:
* **Researchers**: Up-to-date and detailed documents can not only enable you to easily carry out experiments on your own models with only minor modification, but also support you with your research goals with easy implementation.
* **Teachers who need to design a vulnerability-analysis lab for students**: Our hand-by-hand tutorials and various task settings support you to teach vulnerbaility databases and vulnerability-analysis. (We also use this material for vulnerability-analysis lab in our master course, and get nice feedback from the students.)

## Why do we need automatic vulnerability analysis?
Recent advances in data analytics prompt dynamic data-driven vulnerability assessments whereby data contained from vulnerability-alert repositories and standardised enumerations. Yet, current vulnerability assessment processes are mostly conducted manually. However, the huge volume of scanned data requires substantial information processing and analytical reasoning, which could not be satisfied considering the imprecision of manual vulnerability analysis.
