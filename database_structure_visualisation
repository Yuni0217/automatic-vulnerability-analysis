Our **AVA** database is built on top of CVE-Search Python API, 
which brings together CVE and enhancing NVD repositories into a local MongoDB system that can handle large unstructured data. 
When the local MongoDB engine starts running, it is kept synchronised on hourly basis with feeds from repositories data, as illustrated below.
